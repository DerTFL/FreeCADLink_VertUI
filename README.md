- Download the repo by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP"
- Extract the ZIP
- Copy the "Gui" folder to your User/FreeCAD folder:
  - %APPDATA%/FreeCAD on Windows (or C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD)
  - /home/USER/.FreeCAD on Linux
- Run FreeCAD Link
- Tools -> Edit Parameters
- Merge -> From File
- Select VertUI.FCParam
- Repeat that last 3 steps again*

*Loading parameters is still experimental. There are issues that can be fixed by simply re-merging VertUI.FCParam.
I have purposely avoided making a preset configuration, because I found it to be very inconsistent.
